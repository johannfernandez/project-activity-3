# IPv4/IPv6 Address Application

## Project Overview
This Python application is designed as a **prototype tool for network technicians** to retrieve and display the computer’s current **public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses**.  

Using a public REST API (such as [ipapi.co](https://ipapi.co) or [ipstack.com](https://ipstack.com)), the application also provides additional information, including:  
- **Geolocation** (City, Region, Country)  
- **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**  
- **Autonomous System Number (ASN)**  

**Purpose:**  
- Quickly provide IP addressing information for troubleshooting and monitoring.  
- Serve as a prototype for potential future network management tools.
